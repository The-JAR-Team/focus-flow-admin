### GitHub Pages Deployment

The project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. When you push to the main branch, the application will be automatically built and deployed.

You can also manually deploy using:

1. First build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

2. Then deploy to GitHub Pages:
   ```
   npm run deploy
   ```

The site will be accessible at: https://The-JAR-Team.github.io/focus-flow-admin/

### Environment Configuration

The application connects to the backend API configured in `src/utils/config.js`. The configuration includes:

- `baseURL`: The base URL of the API server
- `apiEndpoints`: Object containing all API endpoint paths
  - `login`: Authentication endpoint
  - `logout`: Session termination endpoint
  - `userInfo`: Current user information endpoint
  - `health`: System health status endpoint
  - `debug.sql`: SQL query execution endpoint

## API Integration

The dashboard integrates with the Focus Flow backend API using Axios for all HTTP requests. The integration includes:

- Authentication with secure cookie-based sessions
- User data management
- Session monitoring
- SQL query execution for debugging
- Health status monitoring

### Health Status Monitoring

The dashboard includes a health status indicator in the sidebar that provides real-time information about the backend API:

- **Status Indicator**: Shows if the API is healthy (green) or experiencing issues (red)
- **Version Information**: Displays the current API version
- **Build Details**: Shows the timestamp of the last successful build
- **Auto-refresh**: The status refreshes automatically every 60 seconds

This feature helps administrators quickly identify any backend issues without having to navigate away from their current task.
