# Updated GitHub Pages Navigation Configuration

## Changes Made

1. Created a centralized navigation configuration file (`navigationConfig.js`):
   - Defined routes for internal navigation with React Router
   - Defined full paths for direct URL navigation including the GitHub Pages base path
   - Separated configuration concerns for better maintenance

2. Updated all navigation and redirect paths to use the configuration:
   - Updated `App.jsx` to use navigation config for route definitions
   - Updated `Login.jsx` for dashboard navigation after login
   - Updated `DashboardLayout.jsx` for navigation button actions
   - Updated `ProtectedRoute.jsx` for authentication redirects
   - Updated `api.js` interceptors for 401 unauthorized redirects

3. Ensured all redirects point to the correct GitHub Pages URL:
   - Changed direct paths like `/login` to use `navigationConfig.routes.login`
   - Changed direct URLs like `/#/login` to use `navigationConfig.fullPaths.login` which includes the GitHub Pages base path

## How to Test

1. Login flow:
   - Make sure redirects after login go to `/focus-flow-admin/#/dashboard`
   - Check that login failure stays on the login page

2. Authentication:
   - Verify that when session expires, user is redirected to `/focus-flow-admin/#/login`
   - Check that protected routes redirect to login when not authenticated

3. Navigation:
   - Test that the dashboard button in the sidebar works correctly
   - Verify that logout redirects to the login page with the correct URL

## Benefits

- Centralized route management
- Easier configuration for different deployment environments
- More maintainable code structure
- Consistent URL handling throughout the application
